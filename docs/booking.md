# PC Booking System

Our center at Central Library is very different with our center at YIH. The most notable different is the presence of PC Booking System. Student have to book a computer first before they can use it. They can book a computer using a PC provided near the supervisor desk.

## Blocking a computer through PC Booking System

There is a way for us to block a particular computer. If a computer is having a problem, we can block the computer to prevent user to book that computer. To do that, go to the PC Booking System, or alternatively, you can do this on your computer also by going to [http://172.16.15.79/nusweb/](http://172.16.15.79/nusweb/). 

Enter the admin panel of the PC Booking System software. To do that, enter `commit` as the username, and choose `NUSEXT` as the domain. Click `Log In`. You will not be logged in directly, but you will asked for password instead, since this is the admin panel.

Enter the password and then click `Log In`. After that, click the `Admin` button located on the top right, near the `Log Out` button. After that, click `CBSClient` button. You will see a list of computers

Find the computer you would like to modify, and click the pencil logo on the appropriate row. Choose the mode to either `Available` or `Maintenance`. After that, click the `Save` button on the top of the table to save the pending change.
